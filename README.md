# apply_program overview
This is a simple python game using the Arcade library. I hope that as I continue to practice using several languages that ill get a better grasp on devloping code and have experiance in several languages, which will help in my overall goal to become a excellent software engineer. This projects has the following charecteristics:
The game displays graphics, the game takes user input which for this game takes input from the mouse. 
The game also has the main player sprite which is moved by the mouse, and the goal is for the player sprite to collect the other sprites.
I also added two stretch challenges which is music in the background and three different levels with the first levle has the spites still, 
the second and third levles have moving sprites. I wrote this for the purpose of streatching myself and gain a deeper knowledge and appreciation to writing programs.
